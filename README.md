# PiCar-S_SmartCarProject
This repository provides a holistic summary of a course project I completed during the Spring 2023 semester at the University of West Florida. All of this work is adapted from the SunFounder open-source programming that is used to power a smart car and its three sensor modules: a light follower, a line follower, and an ultrasonic sensor.
