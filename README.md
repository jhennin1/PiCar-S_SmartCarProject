# PiCar-S_SmartCarProject
This repository provides a holistic summary of a course project I completed during the Spring 2023 semester at the University of West Florida. All of this work is adapted from the SunFounder open-source programming that is used to power a smart car and its three sensor modules: a light follower, a line follower, and an ultrasonic sensor. Along with the specific python files that correlate to these sensor modules, there are other files in this repository that pertain to the project and its progress, such as images and figures. This is meant as a summarizing tool to finalize my semester-long project for my autonomous robotics course.
